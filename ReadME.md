### Part 02: Risk Aversion Optimizer

This module helps investors find an optimal portfolio that maximizes their utility given a subjective risk aversion score. It features:

- A behavioral questionnaire (6 questions)
- Calculation of a **risk aversion coefficient (A)** based on responses
- Portfolio optimization (with or without short sales)
- Output of:
  - Expected return
  - Portfolio volatility
  - Utility score
  - Weight distribution (table + pie chart)

- Session tracking for multiple runs

## Sample Data

You can use any historical bond ETF dataset or download from Yahoo Finance. Example tickers:

- AGG, BND, TLT, IEF, SHY, LQD, HYG, TIP, MUB, EMB

## Notes

- This platform is built for educational and demonstration purposes.
- The optimization methods used are simplified and may not reflect real-world constraints.
- Consider extending the platform with backtesting, ESG filtering, and rebalancing simulation.

## Calculation Methodology

This section outlines the theoretical foundations and mathematical formulas employed in the two components of the Robo-Adviser platform: the Efficient Frontier construction based on Modern Portfolio Theory (Part 01), and the utility-maximizing optimal portfolio generation based on investor risk preferences (Part 02).

---

### Part 01: Efficient Frontier â€“ Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

The efficient frontier represents the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a given level of risk. The analysis assumes asset returns are normally distributed and that investors seek to maximize return while minimizing risk, measured by variance.

Given a portfolio of $n$ assets:

- Let $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the vector of expected annualized returns
- Let $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be the covariance matrix of asset returns
- Let $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be the portfolio weights such that $\sum w_i = 1$

The core calculations are as follows:

#### Portfolio Expected Return


$$\mu_p = w^\top \mu$$


#### Portfolio Risk (Volatility)


$$\sigma_p = \sqrt{w^\top \Sigma w}$$


#### Sharpe Ratio

Assuming a constant risk-free rate $ r_f $, the Sharpe ratio is:


$$\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\mu_p - r_f}{\sigma_p}$$


#### Global Minimum Variance Portfolio (GMVP)

The GMVP minimizes portfolio variance irrespective of return preferences. Its closed-form solution is:


$$w_{GMVP} = \frac{\Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1}^\top \Sigma^{-1} \mathbf{1}}$$


Where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones.

#### Efficient Frontier Construction

To construct the frontier, we simulate thousands of random portfolios under:

- **Short-sales allowed**: $w_i \in \mathbb{R}$, $sum w_i = 1$
- **Short-sales disallowed**: $w_i \geq 0$, $\sum w_i = 1$

The frontier is the upper envelope of portfolios with the highest return for a given level of risk. We also identify the **Tangency Portfolio** as the point with the maximum Sharpe ratio.

### Part 02: Utility-Based Optimal Portfolio â€“ Risk Aversion Optimization

This section adopts a **mean-variance utility function** to compute the investor's optimal portfolio, conditioned on a subjective **risk aversion score $A$**. This framework assumes that the investor's utility increases with expected return and decreases with variance.

#### Utility Function


$$U(w) = w^\top \mu - \frac{A}{2} w^\top \Sigma w$$


Where:

- $\mu$: vector of expected returns
- $\Sigma$: covariance matrix of returns
- $A$: investor-specific risk aversion coefficient

#### Optimal Weights

If short selling is allowed, the optimal weights are proportional to the excess expected return scaled by risk:


$$w^* = \frac{\Sigma^{-1} \mu}{\sum |\Sigma^{-1} \mu|}$$


If short selling is disallowed, all negative values in $w^*$ are clipped to zero, and the remaining weights are normalized:


$$w^* = \frac{\max(0, \Sigma^{-1} \mu)}{\sum \max(0, \Sigma^{-1} \mu)}$$


#### Portfolio Metrics under Optimal Weights

- **Expected Return**:


$$\mu_p = w^{*\top} \mu$$


- **Volatility**:


$$\sigma_p = \sqrt{w^{*\top} \Sigma w^*}$$

- **Utility Score**:


$$U = \mu_p - \frac{A}{2} \sigma_p^2$$


#### Risk Aversion Coefficient $A$

The value of $ A $ is determined via a six-question behavioral questionnaire. Higher values of $A$ correspond to more risk-averse profiles. The platform allows users to experiment with different values of$ A$ to observe how optimal allocations shift with investor preferences.
